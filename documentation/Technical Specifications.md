# 6. SYSTEM DESIGN

## 6.1 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES

The Pollen8 platform will utilize the following programming languages, chosen for their suitability to the project requirements, performance, and ecosystem support:

| Language | Purpose | Justification |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| JavaScript (ES6+) | Frontend development, Backend development | - Versatile language for both client and server-side development<br>- Large ecosystem with robust libraries and frameworks<br>- Excellent performance for web applications |
| TypeScript | Frontend and Backend type checking | - Adds static typing to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and maintainability<br>- Improves developer productivity with better tooling and IDE support |

## 6.2 DATABASE DESIGN

Pollen8 will use a combination of PostgreSQL for structured data and MongoDB for unstructured data. Redis will be used as a caching layer. The following diagram illustrates the high-level database design:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    USER ||--o{ INVITE : generates
    USER ||--o{ INDUSTRY : selects
    USER ||--o{ INTEREST : selects
    USER ||--o{ CONNECTION : has
    USER ||--o{ NETWORK_VALUE : calculates
    INVITE ||--o{ INVITE_ACTIVITY : tracks
    INDUSTRY ||--o{ INDUSTRY_NETWORK : belongs_to
    USER ||--o{ INDUSTRY_NETWORK : joins
    INDUSTRY_NETWORK ||--o{ POST : contains
    USER ||--o{ POST : creates

    USER {
        uuid id PK
        string phone_number UK
        string username UK
        string location
        timestamp created_at
        timestamp last_login
    }

    INVITE {
        uuid id PK
        uuid user_id FK
        string link_name
        string link_url UK
        int click_count
        timestamp created_at
    }

    INDUSTRY {
        uuid id PK
        string name UK
    }

    INTEREST {
        uuid id PK
        string name UK
    }

    CONNECTION {
        uuid id PK
        uuid user_id FK
        uuid connected_user_id FK
        timestamp connected_at
    }

    NETWORK_VALUE {
        uuid id PK
        uuid user_id FK
        float value
        timestamp calculated_at
    }

    INVITE_ACTIVITY {
        uuid id PK
        uuid invite_id FK
        date activity_date
        int clicks
    }

    INDUSTRY_NETWORK {
        uuid id PK
        uuid industry_id FK
        string name UK
        timestamp created_at
    }

    POST {
        uuid id PK
        uuid user_id FK
        uuid industry_network_id FK
        text content
        timestamp created_at
    }
```

PostgreSQL will store structured data (USER, INVITE, INDUSTRY, INTEREST, CONNECTION, NETWORK_VALUE, INVITE_ACTIVITY, INDUSTRY_NETWORK), while MongoDB will store unstructured data (POST). Redis will cache frequently accessed data to improve performance.

## 6.3 API DESIGN

Pollen8 will use a RESTful API design for communication between the frontend and backend. The API will be versioned to ensure future compatibility. Here's an overview of the main API endpoints:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[API v1] --> B[/auth]
    A --> C[/users]
    A --> D[/invites]
    A --> E[/industries]
    A --> F[/interests]
    A --> G[/connections]
    A --> H[/network-value]
    A --> I[/industry-networks]
    A --> J[/posts]

    B --> B1[POST /login]
    B --> B2[POST /verify]
    B --> B3[POST /logout]

    C --> C1[GET /profile]
    C --> C2[PUT /profile]

    D --> D1[POST /generate]
    D --> D2[GET /list]
    D --> D3[GET /:id/activity]

    G --> G1[POST /connect]
    G --> G2[GET /list]

    H --> H1[GET /calculate]

    I --> I1[POST /create]
    I --> I2[GET /list]
    I --> I3[GET /:id/posts]

    J --> J1[POST /create]
    J --> J2[GET /:id]
    J --> J3[PUT /:id]
    J --> J4[DELETE /:id]
```

All API endpoints will use JSON for request and response payloads, and will implement proper error handling and status codes.

## 6.4 USER INTERFACE DESIGN

The Pollen8 user interface will be built using React.js components and styled with Tailwind CSS. The design will follow a minimalist black-and-white aesthetic. Here's an overview of the main pages and their key components:

1. Welcome Page
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Welcome Page] --> B[Animated POLLEN8 Text]
    A --> C[GET CONNECTED Button]
    C --> D[Phone Number Input]
    D --> E[VERIFY Button]
```

2. Onboarding Form
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Onboarding Form] --> B[Industry Selection Dropdown]
    A --> C[Interest Selection Dropdown]
    A --> D[ZIP Code Input]
    A --> E[ONBOARD Button]
```

3. User Profile Page
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Profile Page] --> B[Profile Banner]
    A --> C[Metadata Grid]
    A --> D[Manage Invites Button]
    A --> E[Manage Account Button]
```

4. Invite Management Page
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Invite Management Page] --> B[Top Banner]
    A --> C[Invite List]
    C --> D[Expandable Invite Rows]
    A --> E[GENERATE LINK Button]
    E --> F[Link Creation Interface]
```

5. Account Page
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Account Page] --> B[Header]
    A --> C[Profile Banner]
    A --> D[Connections Button]
    A --> E[Network Value Button]
    A --> F[Industry Networks Button]
    A --> G[Dynamic Network Feed]
```

Each page will be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes while maintaining the black-and-white aesthetic. Interactive elements will feature smooth animations and transitions to enhance user experience. Data visualizations, such as network graphs and activity charts, will be implemented using D3.js to provide engaging and informative visual representations of user data.

This system design aligns with the previously specified technologies (React.js, Node.js, D3.js, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis) and provides a solid foundation for building the Pollen8 platform with a focus on performance, scalability, and user experience.

   - A one-time password (OTP) is sent via SMS for verification.

2. Multi-factor Authentication (MFA):
   - Optional MFA for enhanced account security.
   - Supports authenticator apps (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy).

3. JSON Web Tokens (JWT):
   - Used for maintaining user sessions.
   - Short-lived access tokens and longer-lived refresh tokens.

4. Password-less Authentication:
   - Implements WebAuthn standard for biometric and hardware token authentication.

### Authorization

1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):
   - Defines user roles (e.g., regular user, admin, moderator).
   - Permissions are assigned to roles rather than individual users.

2. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):
   - Fine-grained access control based on user attributes and resource properties.

3. OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect:
   - Used for third-party integrations and future mobile app authentication.
