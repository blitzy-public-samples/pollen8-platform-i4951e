   - Header with pulsing orb and invite link generation icon
   - Profile banner with animated star constellation background
   - Buttons for Connections, Network Value, and Industry Networks
   - Dynamic network feed based on selected option

## 5.2 SOFTWARE INTERFACES

The Pollen8 platform will interact with various software components and third-party services. Key software interfaces include:

1. Backend API (Node.js):
   - RESTful API endpoints for all frontend-backend communications
   - JSON data format for request and response payloads
   - JWT-based authentication for secure API access

2. Database:
   - Interface with the chosen database system (to be determined)
   - ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) layer for efficient data access and manipulation

3. Authentication Service:
   - Integration with a third-party phone number-based authentication service
   - OAuth 2.0 protocol for secure token-based authentication

4. Analytics Platform:
   - API integration with a third-party analytics service
   - Event tracking for user actions and platform usage

5. Cloud Storage Service:
   - API integration for storing and retrieving user-generated content (e.g., profile pictures)
   - Secure access controls and encryption for stored data

6. Email Service Provider:
   - SMTP or API integration for sending transactional emails (e.g., invite notifications)

7. Content Delivery Network (CDN):
   - Integration for efficient delivery of static assets (images, CSS, JavaScript files)

## 5.3 COMMUNICATION INTERFACES

The Pollen8 platform will utilize various communication interfaces to ensure efficient data exchange and system interactions:

1. HTTP/HTTPS:
   - All client-server communications will use HTTPS protocol
   - TLS 1.3 encryption for secure data transmission

2. WebSocket:
   - Real-time updates for notifications and live data changes
   - Secure WebSocket (WSS) protocol for encrypted communications

3. RESTful API:
   - JSON data format for all API requests and responses
   - Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations
   - Versioned API endpoints (e.g., /api/v1/) for future compatibility

4. Database Communication:
   - Secure TCP/IP connection to the database server
   - Prepared statements and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection

5. Third-party API Integrations:
   - OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication with external services
   - API-specific protocols and data formats as required by each service

6. Mobile Deep Linking:
   - Implementation of deep linking protocols for seamless mobile app integration (future feature)

7. Push Notifications:
   - Integration with platform-specific push notification services (iOS, Android, web) for future mobile app support

8. Rate Limiting:
   - Implementation of rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage

9. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):
   - Proper CORS configuration to allow secure cross-origin requests from approved domains

10. Caching:
    - Implementation of caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) for improved performance and reduced server load

These communication interfaces will be implemented using industry-standard protocols and best practices to ensure security, efficiency, and scalability of the Pollen8 platform.
